Australia Time Zones - Future Time Converter
This project is a simple web application that allows users to convert a selected future date and time from one time zone to multiple time zones in Australia. It also provides a dropdown menu for selecting the source time zone from which the conversion will be performed.

Features
Users can select a future date and time using the datetime-local input field.
Users can select the source time zone (fromTimeZone) from a dropdown menu populated with time zone options fetched from the TimeZoneDB API.
The application converts the selected future date and time from the source time zone to multiple time zones in Australia (Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Darwin, Perth) using the TimeZoneDB API.
The converted date and time for each time zone are displayed in their respective containers on the webpage.
